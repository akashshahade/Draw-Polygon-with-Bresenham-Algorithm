# Draw-Polygon-with-Bresenham-Algorithm

We all know Bresenham's line drawing algorithm. I have modified it to draw a polygon of any number of sides.
Input is from user about the number of sides.
And then it asks about the coordinates of endpoints of line as done in Bresenham algorithm.
Enjoy. 
Please follow me.
